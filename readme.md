# Plain Music
*Plain Music* is a text format for writing music. It uses only ASCII characters, it is terse, regular, readable by humans, and easy to parse and generate for machines. For a full writeup of the format read the article [here](https://pellejuul.github.io/drafts/2017-03-08-plain-music-notation.html).

This repository doesn't not contain any code, but acts as a gateway for *Plain Music* resources.

## Using Plain Music
*Plain Music* is usable without any specific software, you just need a text editor. Since *Plain Music* is a very young format, not many tools have been developed for it yet. Some suggestions for tools to be developed are:

* Parser and generator libraries
* *Plain Music* to standard notation converter
* MIDI to and form *Plain Music* converter
* MusicXML to and form *Plain Music* converter

Some tools are already under development:
* [Javascript parser/generator library](https://github.com/PelleJuul/plain-music.js)

## Contributing
Since *Plain Music* is so young the best way of contributing is to use it, and create an [issue](https://github.com/PelleJuul/plain-music/issues) on this repository with feedback.

You can also help out by using contributing to on of the *Plain Music* tools - for example the [Javascript library](https://github.com/PelleJuul/plain-music.js)
